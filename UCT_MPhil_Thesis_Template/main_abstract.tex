﻿\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{report} % Remove draft option to show figures (for final draft), otherwise keep for faster production

%\documentclass[12pt,oneside]{book}  % Remove draft option to show figures (for final draft), otherwise keep for faster production

% LaTeX knows three standard font sizes:
% 10pt (default)
% 11pt
% 12pt


% the document should be presented on single-sided a4 paper and typeset in a double-spaced size 10-12 font;
% the left-hand margin should be at least 1.5 inches (4cm) to allow for binding;
% the other three margins should be at least 1 inch (2.5cm).
\usepackage[left=1.5in, right=1in, top=1in, bottom=1in, includefoot, headheight=13.6pt]{geometry}

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3} % default value for 'report' class is "2". When set to 3, you can reference subsubsection

\listfiles % List packages used in .log file

%On Overleaf, texcount utility to count the words in the project's main file and any files imported into your project's main file via \include and \input.


% common packages in Latex
% graphicx: Indispensable when working with figures/graphs.
% subfig: Controlling arrangement of several figures (e.g. 2×2 matrix)
% minitoc: Adds mini table of contents to every chapter
% nomencl: Generate and format a nomenclature
% listings: Source code printer for LaTeX
% babel: Multilingual package for standard document classes
% fancyhdr: Controlling header and footer
% hyperref: Hypertext links for LaTeX

%Indentation
%By default, LaTeX does not indent the first paragraph of a section or a chapter. The size of the subsequent paragraph indents is determined by \parindent.
%If you want to create a non-indented paragraph, like the second one in the example, put the command \noindent at the beginning of it. If you want the whole document not to be indented, set the indentation length to zero with \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}.
%On the other side, if you want to indent a paragraph that is not indented you can use \indent right above it. It should be noted that this command will only have an effect when \parindent is set to zero. Also, the default value for \parindent in one-column documents is 15pt when the default text size is 10pt , 17pt for 11pt , and 1.5em for 12pt .
\setlength{\parindent}{1.5em}
%\setlength{\parskip}{1em} %\parskip, this determines the space between a paragraph and the preceding text.
